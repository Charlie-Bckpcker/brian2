  summary: 'A clock-driven simulator for spiking neural networks'
  description: |
    Brian2 is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on almost all platforms.
    The motivation for this project is that a simulator should not only save the time of
    processors, but also the time of scientists.

    It is the successor of Brian1 and shares its approach of being highly flexible
    and easily extensible. It is based on a code generation framework that allows
    to execute simulations using other programming languages and/or on different
    devices.
